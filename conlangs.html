<h1>Conlangs</h1>
<p>Constructed Languages (conlangs for short) are languages that are created and designed rather than naturally evolved. There are many reasons to invent languages, but I make languages for fun. Sometimes they are connected to fantasy worlds, but most of the time I create them for the fun of creating languages, and I have no ideas in mind. Conlanging takes a lot of work and a conlang can never be considered complete, as there are always new words to add. I also take commissions for conlangs. Send me an email for details about pricing!</p>
<h6>Commissions: Open</h6>
<p>Here are some examples of my current and previous projects:</p>
