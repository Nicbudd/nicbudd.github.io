<p>Do you like this new version? I personally think it's <b>MUCH</b> better than the previous one. What do you guys think? What should I improve? Send me a message!</p>
<p>Just so that you can get a feel for the website, I'm gonna throw some more colors down here.</p>

</div><div class="blueblock"><h2>Blue</h2>

<p>This one is blue</p>

</div><div class="blackblock"><h2>Black</h2>

<p>Wow edgy</p>

</div><div class="redblock"><h2>Red</h2>

<p>You never mix the colors with each other, always put one of the neutral colors (black, light gray or white) between them</p>
