  <h1>Welcome!</h1>

  <p>
    You've reached the website of Nicolas Zerbinopoulos. I am a 22 year old 
    Computer Engineering major from Southern New Hampshire, currently attending
    University of New Hampshire. I enjoy computer science, engineering, 
    meteorology, Rubik's cube speedsolving, Linux, homelabbing, math, physics, 
    aviation, rocketry, web design, stenography, speedrunning, worldbuilding, 
    conlanging, and way more things than I have the patience to list.
  </p>

  <p>I've had this website for nearly a decade now, and the site has gone 
    through several design iterations, this most recent one starting in 2019.
    This page is a permanent work in progress.
    Any bad code on this website was my attempt at applying my rudimentary
    programming and javascript skills. 
  </p>

  <p>Explore my site using the menu on the side!</p>

  <h2>Programming</h2>

  <p>Programming and computer science in general has rapidly taken up much of my
    free time. I started my journey unconventionally by writing a verb
    conjugation tool in Google Sheets in middle school, but my desires quickly 
    outgrew the medium of Google Sheets. I learned Javascript in high school, 
    eventually making this website and several other fun things, especially in
    p5js. In my electrical engineering studies at Western Michigan University I 
    learned Python, which I found to be much more elegant and useful. I learned 
    Java and C through college, but evenutally tried out Rust and got hooked. 
    Rust is now my default language of choice when starting a new project.
  </p>

  <p><b>Languages:</b> Rust, Python, Javascript, Java, C, MATLAB</p>

  <h4>Projects</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Nicbudd/wxer_lib">wxer_lib</a> - Library 
      for meteorological data collection, standardization, and redistribution.
      Has helpful formulae for calculating other parameters on the data. Made 
      for (currently closed-source) weather database for use with other 
      applications.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Nicbudd/unifetch">unifetch</a> - Highly 
      customizable command line application that displays lots of data in a
      consise format.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/Nicbudd/iemreader">iemreader</a> - Live feed
      of NWSChat for terminal, sourced from Iowa Environmental Mesonet. 
      Highlights important features of messages, filters out uninteresting
      messages.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Conlangs</h2>
  <p>Constructed Languages (conlangs for short) are languages that are created 
    and designed rather than naturally evolved. There are many reasons to invent
    languages, but I make languages for fun. Sometimes they are connected to 
    fantasy worlds, but most of the time I create them for the fun of creating 
    languages, and I have no ideas in mind. Conlanging takes a lot of work and a
    conlang can never be considered complete, as there are always new words to 
    add. I also take commissions for conlangs. Send me an email for details 
    about pricing!</p>
  <p>As of January 2025, I've largely moved on from conlanging as I've lost 
    much interest. I do still take requests, and you are more than welcome to
    send an email with a request.</p>
  <!-- <h6>Commissions: Open</h6> -->
  <p>Examples of previous projects:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="zythe.html">Zythë</a> - My most developed conlang, yet also older
    and less naturalistic</li>

  <li><a href="Mobian Reference Grammar.pdf">Mobian (PDF)</a> - fiverr 
    commission featuring some grammar, vocabulary, and multiple writing systems.
  </li>

  <li><a href="hypernavajo.html">Unnamed</a> - unnaturalistic, ambitious conlang
    based on hypothetical communication of fantasy world spirits
