<h2>Lore & History</h2><br>

<p>On a different world, a village of humans lived. They were very similar to us. They never truly knew where they came from, just like us, and they could only imagine that another world existed with other humans on it.
</p><p>They lived near the ocean on a polar ice cap. There were a few other villages nearby that kept in contact with this one, but never very regularly, as the terrain and climate made travel very dangerous. The village of around 300 people relied heavily on a large ocean dwelling animal, known as “sifa”, who were similar to whales. They made windproof coats, sheets, and tarps out of its skin, and structures, such as houses, out of its bones. They ate the animal's flesh for food, and used it's fat for candles and fire. They made string out of strong, tall, fibrous plants that grew in the water.
</p><p>The village needed all of these resources, so during the summer time, when the sea ice melted, large fishing boats, crewed by about 20 people each, were launched to catch sifa. It was a big risk for the village to send so many people on one trip, but the trips rarely went wrong if crewed by experienced people. After all, the village needed to eat or else they would starve. The boats were designed to be very stable, made of bones, fiber, skins, and driftwood, weather was forecasted, waves were measured, and in the rare event of a boat sinking, they had smaller lifeboats to save some of their lives.
</p><p>On one such trip, the worst scenario occurred. An unusually strong storm struck their vessel. They rode waves many times taller than their houses, winds stronger than even the more experienced mentors had ever seen. A harpoon poked through the strong hide of the boat, and the boat started taking on water. Rain and snow came down hard, causing visibility to drop.
</p><p>In their panic, 12 people boarded lifeboats and fled. The other 9 started trying to repair the fishing boat. The hole grew bigger and bigger, and at some point all of the people on board were taking apart the boat frantically, trying to get anything they can to float. One last wave rips the boat in half and 7 people are never seen again.
</p><p>After the rain and winds cleared, it became very clear that the shore was gone. The people who were still alive were stranded, alone in the open ocean. One boat had 9 people on it, the other one had 3. In the morning, the boat with 9 found a stranded woman, clinging onto a piece of the ship. They welcomed her onboard, making them a boat of 10. The two boats eventually found each other and the passengers connected the two boats together. Later that day, they came across a dead body floating on another piece of wreckage.
</p><p>Winds and water currents pushed the boat north, and away from their homeland. They were running out of food and water and started coming up with gruesome plans on what to do. The next day, they discovered an island in the distance. They used their training and strength to bring themselves towards it. When they arrived, they realized it was no ordinary island, it was a floating paradise island.
</p><p>In more tropical areas, a plant has found a way to take advantage of the ocean and its sunlight. It grows on the water, growing strong air sacs that it floats on. A huge leaf is connected via strong 4m high stalks to the air sacs. The leaf expands outwards from the center and grows more stalks downwards, which, when they hit water, create more air sacs, connecting with the other air sacs to create a strong flat surface on top. An isolated ecosystem lives on the island. Small animals, known as “äshëku”, fish from the side of the island, and when they die, the plant absorbs their body to gather nutrients. In return, the island uses reverse osmosis and collects rainwater from the many tropical storms to create fresh water for the animals. Mosses and fungi grow on the floor of the island, consuming energy that the main plant missed. When they die, they are consumed by the plant. Some of these islands can grow to be over a half kilometer wide.
</p><p>Our travelers found an island that measured around 300m. It normally inhabited much warmer waters, but was blown much further south than normal by the storm. They were very relieved to find it, it saved their lives. It had fresh water, edible plants, and a few species of these “äshëku”. For now, they were safe. They continued to drift northwards towards the equator, pushed by winds and ocean currents. After 5 months of drifting, the island hit the shores of a new continent.
</p><p>This new continent was a jungle, never inhabited by humans. There was an excess of plants, foods, herbs, fungi, animals, sunlight, and warmth. Rain fell every day and caused low areas to flood. In this new land, these people made the best of their new environment. They stopped wearing their fat filled whale-skin clothing, and started to eat what they had around them. These 14 people. They named themselves “the travelers” (zythë), and started a small village, and tried to survive on what they had

<h5>Syllable Structure</h5>
<p>Syllables in Zythë are restricted to CV in the middle of words, however, they may be (C)V at the beginning of words and CV(C) at the ends of words. guzi, guzik, uzik, and uzi are all valid words</p>	

<h6>Vowel Strength Hierarchy</h6>
<p>When two vowels touch for grammatical reasons, breaking the syllable structure, the vowel strength hierarchy will determine which vowel is "stronger" and gets used at the junction. If they are on the same level on the hierarchy, the vowel in the root word is considered stronger.</p>	

Vowel Strength Hierarchy:
<ul>
<li>î is stronger than ë</li>
<li>all vowels except î and ë are stronger than î</li>
<li>ä is stronger than a</li>
</ul>
