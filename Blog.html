<h4>February 28th, 2018</h4>
<p>Today is Rare Disease Day (February 28th), and I would like to talk about what life is like living with someone with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

	</p><p>For those who don't know, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a genetic disease that affects connective tissue all across the body. It is caused by a mutation to DNA that inhibits production of certain types of Collagen, which is a molecule that is crucial to the structure of your body and an integral part of the cellular structure of your body.

</p><p>Such a big part of the body getting affected like that leads to many side effects and issues. It leads to a better chance of dislocating joints or stretching muscles too far, chronic pain, stretchy skin, hyper flexibility, and many other specific health problems.

</p><p>Specific side effects my mom has had to deal with over the years includes (but aren't limited to): aura and hemiplegic migraines, constant nausea, stretch marks all over, inability to lose weight, kidney stones, hyperdontia (growing extra random teeth), low blood pressure, variable blood pressure, hypoglycemia, I don't know what this one is called but she craves salty food after having sugary foods, insomnia, 10+ agressive adenomas in breasts, more in colon, stomach ulcers, bladder ulcers and pain, and more.

</p><p>Due to these symptoms and medical issues, she has had to have the following issues/surgeries: Hysterectomy (removal of uterus), Double Mastectomy (removal of both breasts),  countless surgeries to remove kidney stones, rapid weight gain, and, probably worst of all, the loss of morale, the will to keep going.

</p><p>And despite all of this, she is the most powerful woman that I know. She fought back this, her rough childhood, having to raise a baby and work a job at 17, and she built her life from the ground up. She is confident, she is smart, she commands people, she brings attention, she brings power, and she set aside her hardships and used her greatest strengths and abilities to work her way up in her job and position, and to gain wealth for us, to get out of the poverty her parents lived in to take me and my brother to a better neighborhood, in an bigger house, and to give us the ability to go to whatever college we choose.

</p><p>Her story is why I want to be like her. I talk to her occasionally, not often enough, so that I can see how she does it. I want to be like her. Even though this EDS barrier holds her back, she still gets up every day and trys to be the best person she can. Hell, if I was in her shoes, I wouldn't be able to handle it and give up. She is the only person I know who could handle such a horrible condition and still be as good as she is.

<p>I woke up Sunday, 9:00 am. Today, we are going to Illinois to see the eclipse. I've been anticipating this for the past two years. Two years ago, it was "August 21, 2017". In January, it was "August 21st". In the beginning of August, it was "The 21st". A few days ago, it was just "Monday". Now it's just "Tomorrow". My dad gets up at 11:00 am and we pack until 12:30 am. We say our last goodbyes and we're off.

</p><p>At first, it was a little interesting. I hadn't been out of the state in over a month. We visited Vermont, which was a little different. Then it was Massachusetts, still a little different. New York was where it started to get weird. The land was flat, the rocks were black, and I had that "We're not in Kansas anymore" feeling. We stayed in New York for a very long time. A long enough time for the sun to start setting.

</p><p>We entered Pennsylvania for, what looked like a small blip on the map, but was much larger than I expected. That's when I realized how massive the United States is. When we entered Ohio, it was pitch black. I was slowly nodding off. We decided to stop in a Walmart parking lot and sleep for 4 hours. No more, or we wouldn't make the deadline, no less, or we'd be sure to get a sleep deprivation induced car crash. When we woke up I felt much better. Sadly my dad only got about 2 hours of sleep.

</p><p>We knew that the weather was going to be something we needed to decide last minute. I noticed Nashville was closer and had better weather than our original destination, Carbondale, Illinois. So we decided to go just north of Nashville to get the best spot. We crossed through Kentucky, with surprisingly little traffic and landed in Tennessee.

</p><p>My dad wanted to be on the line of maximum, so we stopped in a small town called Cross Plains, Tennessee. They were expecting us. A local restaurant had new dishes that were, of course, all eclipse puns, there was paid parking, crowds of people standing in tents, and all of the things you might think of when you go to a town expecting tons of people.

</p><p>C1. The first point at which the moon contacts the sun. It took a few moments for people to see any decent chunk taken out of the Sun, but slowly it got bigger. Eclipse glasses were being handed out to people who didn't have them. Some of the shops started shutting down.

</p><p>The moon is halfway covered by the Moon. We are right in front of the food establishment where the employees and a few customers stay. "Let's go to the group of people in the field by the cemetery". When we get there, we realize that it's a local church that's set up the event. I don't hate churches and religions, but I think it would be awkward to be an atheist among a crowd of Christians. We continue up the road and we see a person stopped by the road. We park next to him and start talking. He's from Michigan and, surprisingly, has a nephew in New Hampshire.

</p><p>10 minutes until totality. I set up a timer and we start counting down. It's slowly getting darker. Some crickets start chirping. From our eclipse glasses we see a small crescent of the sun. I look back at the ground, and it's even darker. 5 minutes. The birds are going crazy, dazed by the sudden darkness. Cricket chirping is getting out of control. The temperature has gone from a humid 90 to a cool 75

</p><p>2 minutes. Bright sunset colors are appearing in the background. "Do you see that," my dad says, "You can see it darkening!" He's right, I can see the ground getting dark. 1 minute until totality, I see it.

</p><p>To describe "Shadow Snakes", imagine what it looks like at the bottom of a pool, how there are darker and lighter parts all moving around somewhat haphazardly. Or what the hot air rising over a black tar looks like. Now, imagine that, except it's all in long strings heading away from you. Kinda like thousands of little snakes. As soon as they disappeared, we knew it was safe to look at the sun.

</p><p>The next 20 seconds were amazingly beautiful. The sun looked like a diamond ring, a big black hole with a little bit of sun on all sides, but a huge gem sparkling into your eyes on one side. It got smaller and smaller. In a few seconds, it was reduced to half its size. Eventually, we could see little bits of light poking out through valleys on the moon and disappear. The diamond gem disappears and we are left with a few bright beads of light. The moment they disappear, a white glow surrounds it and reveals a dramatic display of the sun's corona and the solar winds coming out of it.

</p><p>As soon as it appears, it's so beautiful that nothing can pull you away. Not the 360 degree sunset around you can take your eyes off it for more than 5 seconds. It's a jet black circle surrounded by a white glow with massive tentacles. That in itself is not incredible. It's how unnatural it is. The Sun, which is shining every day, is gone. You feel connected with nature, with everyone in the world. You can't help but to shake, to feel your knees go weak and give out. This sounds extremely ridiculous, but anyone who's been there knows this other worldly feeling and would probably agree me.

</p><p>After just 2 minutes, the same thing happens in reverse. First, a few beads appear, and then a diamond, which grows bigger. Once it gets too bright to see, you can see the shadow snakes again, which get more and more visible until they quickly fade away. But then it's over.

</p><p>That's it. Everything goes back to normal.

</p><p>It hits you that you need to see it again. You need to see the next one. I don't care where the next one is, but we're gonna see it. It was all worth it. The 13 hour drive, 4 hour sleep, the 4 hour drive, almost witnessing an accident, was entirely worth it. Hell, I would do that 10 times over just to see it again. Screw waiting 7 years, I would walk through the Sahara Desert for 2 days without water to see the next one.

</p><p>It's been 6 hours and I'm still trying to process it. We still have 3 more days on this trip and St. Louis, Chicago, Toronto, and Ottawa are all still on the itinerary, but the eclipse beats all of those cities combined.

</p><p>If a total solar eclipse ever passes any where near you, go to it. Bring your family. Bring your entire family. Bring your friends, your cousins, and everyone you care about. They will never ever forget it.
