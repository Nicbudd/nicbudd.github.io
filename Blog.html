		<li><h2>The incredible story of my own mother.</h2></li>
		<li><h6>February 28, 2018</h6></li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<p>Today is Rare Disease Day (February 28th), and I would like to talk about what life is like living with someone with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

	</p><p>For those who don't know, Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a genetic disease that affects connective tissue all across the body. It is caused by a mutation to DNA that inhibits production of certain types of Collagen, which is a molecule that is crucial to the structure of your body and an integral part of the cellular structure of your body.

</p><p>Such a big part of the body getting affected like that leads to many side effects and issues. It leads to a better chance of dislocating joints or stretching muscles too far, chronic pain, stretchy skin, hyper flexibility, and many other specific health problems.

</p><p>Specific side effects my mom has had to deal with over the years includes (but aren't limited to): aura and hemiplegic migraines, constant nausea, stretch marks all over, inability to lose weight, kidney stones, hyperdontia (growing extra random teeth), low blood pressure, variable blood pressure, hypoglycemia, I don't know what this one is called but she craves salty food after having sugary foods, insomnia, 10+ agressive adenomas in breasts, more in colon, stomach ulcers, bladder ulcers and pain, and more.

</p><p>Due to these symptoms and medical issues, she has had to have the following issues/surgeries: Hysterectomy (removal of uterus), Double Mastectomy (removal of both breasts),  countless surgeries to remove kidney stones, rapid weight gain, and, probably worst of all, the loss of morale, the will to keep going.

</p><p>And despite all of this, she is the most powerful woman that I know. She fought back this, her rough childhood, having to raise a baby and work a job at 17, and she built her life from the ground up. She is confident, she is smart, she commands people, she brings attention, she brings power, and she set aside her hardships and used her greatest strengths and abilities to work her way up in her job and position, and to gain wealth for us, to get out of the poverty her parents lived in to take me and my brother to a better neighborhood, in an bigger house, and to give us the ability to go to whatever college we choose.

</p><p>Her story is why I want to be like her. I talk to her occasionally, not often enough, so that I can see how she does it. I want to be like her. Even though this EDS barrier holds her back, she still gets up every day and trys to be the best person she can. Hell, if I was in her shoes, I wouldn't be able to handle it and give up. She is the only person I know who could handle such a horrible condition and still be as good as she is.

		<li><h2> Words do not describe it. </h2></li>
		<li><h6>August 22, 2017</h6></li>
	</ul>
		
<p>I woke up Sunday, 9:00 am. Today, we are going to Illinois to see the eclipse. I've been anticipating this for the past two years. Two years ago, it was "August 21, 2017". In January, it was "August 21st". In the beginning of August, it was "The 21st". A few days ago, it was just "Monday". Now it's just "Tomorrow". My dad gets up at 11:00 am and we pack until 12:30 am. We say our last goodbyes and we're off.

</p><p>At first, it was a little interesting. I hadn't been out of the state in over a month. We visited Vermont, which was a little different. Then it was Massachusetts, still a little different. New York was where it started to get weird. The land was flat, the rocks were black, and I had that "We're not in Kansas anymore" feeling. We stayed in New York for a very long time. A long enough time for the sun to start setting.

</p><p>We entered Pennsylvania for, what looked like a small blip on the map, but was much larger than I expected. That's when I realized how massive the United States is. When we entered Ohio, it was pitch black. I was slowly nodding off. We decided to stop in a Walmart parking lot and sleep for 4 hours. No more, or we wouldn't make the deadline, no less, or we'd be sure to get a sleep deprivation induced car crash. When we woke up I felt much better. Sadly my dad only got about 2 hours of sleep.

</p><p>We knew that the weather was going to be something we needed to decide last minute. I noticed Nashville was closer and had better weather than our original destination, Carbondale, Illinois. So we decided to go just north of Nashville to get the best spot. We crossed through Kentucky, with surprisingly little traffic and landed in Tennessee.

</p><p>My dad wanted to be on the line of maximum, so we stopped in a small town called Cross Plains, Tennessee. They were expecting us. A local restaurant had new dishes that were, of course, all eclipse puns, there was paid parking, crowds of people standing in tents, and all of the things you might think of when you go to a town expecting tons of people.

</p><p>C1. The first point at which the moon contacts the sun. It took a few moments for people to see any decent chunk taken out of the Sun, but slowly it got bigger. Eclipse glasses were being handed out to people who didn't have them. Some of the shops started shutting down.

</p><p>The moon is halfway covered by the Moon. We are right in front of the food establishment where the employees and a few customers stay. "Let's go to the group of people in the field by the cemetery". When we get there, we realize that it's a local church that's set up the event. I don't hate churches and religions, but I think it would be awkward to be an atheist among a crowd of Christians. We continue up the road and we see a person stopped by the road. We park next to him and start talking. He's from Michigan and, surprisingly, has a nephew in New Hampshire.

</p><p>10 minutes until totality. I set up a timer and we start counting down. It's slowly getting darker. Some crickets start chirping. From our eclipse glasses we see a small crescent of the sun. I look back at the ground, and it's even darker. 5 minutes. The birds are going crazy, dazed by the sudden darkness. Cricket chirping is getting out of control. The temperature has gone from a humid 90 to a cool 75

</p><p>2 minutes. Bright sunset colors are appearing in the background. "Do you see that," my dad says, "You can see it darkening!" He's right, I can see the ground getting dark. 1 minute until totality, I see it.

</p><p>To describe "Shadow Snakes", imagine what it looks like at the bottom of a pool, how there are darker and lighter parts all moving around somewhat haphazardly. Or what the hot air rising over a black tar looks like. Now, imagine that, except it's all in long strings heading away from you. Kinda like thousands of little snakes. As soon as they disappeared, we knew it was safe to look at the sun.

</p><p>The next 20 seconds were amazingly beautiful. The sun looked like a diamond ring, a big black hole with a little bit of sun on all sides, but a huge gem sparkling into your eyes on one side. It got smaller and smaller. In a few seconds, it was reduced to half its size. Eventually, we could see little bits of light poking out through valleys on the moon and disappear. The diamond gem disappears and we are left with a few bright beads of light. The moment they disappear, a white glow surrounds it and reveals a dramatic display of the sun's corona and the solar winds coming out of it.

</p><p>As soon as it appears, it's so beautiful that nothing can pull you away. Not the 360 degree sunset around you can take your eyes off it for more than 5 seconds. It's a jet black circle surrounded by a white glow with massive tentacles. That in itself is not incredible. It's how unnatural it is. The Sun, which is shining every day, is gone. You feel connected with nature, with everyone in the world. You can't help but to shake, to feel your knees go weak and give out. This sounds extremely ridiculous, but anyone who's been there knows this other worldly feeling and would probably agree me.

</p><p>After just 2 minutes, the same thing happens in reverse. First, a few beads appear, and then a diamond, which grows bigger. Once it gets too bright to see, you can see the shadow snakes again, which get more and more visible until they quickly fade away. But then it's over.

</p><p>That's it. Everything goes back to normal.

</p><p>It hits you that you need to see it again. You need to see the next one. I don't care where the next one is, but we're gonna see it. It was all worth it. The 13 hour drive, 4 hour sleep, the 4 hour drive, almost witnessing an accident, was entirely worth it. Hell, I would do that 10 times over just to see it again. Screw waiting 7 years, I would walk through the Sahara Desert for 2 days without water to see the next one.

</p><p>It's been 6 hours and I'm still trying to process it. We still have 3 more days on this trip and St. Louis, Chicago, Toronto, and Ottawa are all still on the itinerary, but the eclipse beats all of those cities combined.

</p><p>If a total solar eclipse ever passes any where near you, go to it. Bring your family. Bring your entire family. Bring your friends, your cousin's, and everyone you care about. They will never ever forget it.

		<li><h2> Do I have autism?</h2> </li>
		<li><h6>August 18, 2017</h6></li>
	</ul>
		
	<p>I was intending to do Part 2 of the Yearly Recap, but I am too tired and something else got in the way so I wanna talk about this instead.

</p><p>Me and my family watched a show today. It was called <em>Atypical</em>, and it was about an 18 year old boy who has Autism. While we were watching it, I noticed similarities between him and myself. We both like to document things, we both have social problems, we both give random facts, and we both like silence and alone time. I asked my mom in the middle of it "Wow, these seem like symptoms that I have. Do I have autism?", and she replied with "I don't know, I've never thought of it before, we should talk to your therapist about it." What I'm thinking is "You've never wondered if I had Autism or not? Doesn't it seem obvious to ask that about a child who acts like me?"

</p><p>I have a little bit of a theory. I'm not a psychologist, or sociologist, or anything. I just think a lot. I've noticed that most people <em>tend to</em> fall on a spectrum. On the left side you have people who are not very intelligent but very social, and on the right side you have people who are not very social but very intelligent. I'm not saying that everyone is this way, I know of many people who are very social but also very smart, I'm just saying that I think most people do. I think that Autism Spectrum Disorder is a term used for the people on the very far right of the scale, because we like classifying things. I think that I am very far right on the spectrum, and I might be so far right that I fall within that line. I've been doing my best to head towards the middle in every day life.

</p><p>Those are just my thoughts, I'm not a professional, but let me know if you'd like to say something. My email is niczippy77@gmail.com

		<li><h2> Yearly Recap, Part 1</h2> </li>
		<li><h6>August 17, 2017</h6></li>
	</ul>
		
		<p>Alright everyone! Time for your yearly recap of what's going on in my life! I wanna make this a daily thing, to write before I go to bed, but first off...
</p>

<h3>I'm gay</h3>

<p>It's true. My sexual orientation is bisexual. For now, though, I am only looking for male partners. I tell a lot of people that I am gay, and I say that because I am only looking for male partners right now, but if I said that I was gay, then I was probably lying, to you and myself.

</p><p>Anyways, my life has changed very quickly, chaotically, and confusingly over the past year or so. The funny thing is that the last post here was right before everything started changing.
</p>

<h3>December 2016:</h3>

<p>My mom is contemplating putting down our dog Max due to how many people he has bitten. While this decision process is moving along, Max bites her and the decision to put him down is made relatively quickly after that point. It was a heartbreaking experience. I had lost dogs before, we had to give away Bella to our neighbors because we couldn't keep two dogs in the household. We only had her for two years, and she was going to the neighbors, so it was fine. We then got another dog, Maddie, who we had for 3.5 years, and she was given away to one of my moms friends. We've lost contact with them, and I will likely never see her again. I at least had a rational reason to giving her away. We found out my mom was allergic to dogs, and so we thought it would improve her health. It was still much harder than giving Bella away, because she was my Christmas Gift, she was my dog. I wanted a Black Labrador.

</p><p>Max was harder to give away. Max was with us for 12-13 years. I remember picking him up when he was a puppy, and I was 3. In my mind, he was a part of the family, as close as my brother, and, in my mind, we didn't have a legitimate reason to kill him. He bit my mom. So? He's bitten plenty of people before. It made me angry, furious. I told my friends, they were furious. They wanted to rescue him, steal him from us so that we couldn't kill him. I was counting down the days. Days before I had a plan. I was going to take whatever I could find in the medicine cabinet and take it all. I wanted them to feel the pain I felt for Max, I wanted them to know what it's like to lose a loved one. If I lived, then I could tell them my message directly to their face. If I died, at least I could see Max in heaven, or, if they take my message, let him live happily on this planet for at least one more year.


</p><p><b>December 20, 2016: </b>The day we put him down. Afterwards, to calm all of our spirits, we sat down together and watched a movie. Zootopia. <mark>Mild Zootopia spoilers ahead.</mark>

</p><p>For my entire life, I had known that I had a fascination, an infatuation with anthropomorphic animals, animals that walk and talk and act like humans. Of course, I haven't known the word "Anthropomorphic" my entire life. This movie kick started whatever was in my brain that liked Anthros into high gear. The movie itself was amazing, the plot, the story, but I couldn't get past how they looked. I could relate to them so much better. Their facial expressions, the way they reacted to things, I could pick up on much easier. When Nick Wilde was being caught for Tax Evasion, I could see the expression on his face and tell the exact emotions he was feeling, and it was immediately funnier, to me, than a human character could ever have made it, because I could read his emotions better. I was also just fascinated by their tails, ears, and strange looking heads. It almost came naturally to like anthros. Soon after the film, I started wondering if that was normal, or if I was a furry.


</p><p><b>December 26, 2016: </b>Nothing special happened throughout most of the day. Late at night, I was on reddit, specifically /r/AskReddit. One of the top posts at the time was titled "Furries of reddit, why?" This was the deciding moment. I knew going into that thread that my life would either be very different, with my love for anthros being a very large part of my life, or not changed at all, and my life would be resorted to hiding this love for anthros. I think I knew what would happen going into that thread. That thread showed me that fursuiting is a form of escapism, the furry community is very loving and welcoming, and, yes, I do enjoy anthropomorphic animals. I was overwhelmed by how much I wanted to join this community. Then, something incredible happened.

</p><p>I was looking through comics that were on the thread and I found this (NSFW). For those that don't want to go to that (Very NSFW) site, Basically it's a story about a group of furries, and the comic creator is just getting into the fandom. He roleplays, or pretends to be a female anthro. Slowly, him and another guy build up a sexual relationship, and eventually they want to meet. The comic creator tells him "I have a confession to make... I'm not actually a girl", and he says "So?"

</p><p>My immediate reaction was shock, followed by confusion. "What, that's crazy, normal people care about other people's gender before dating someone! I certainly wouldn't want to date a gu..." I stopped and thought about that statement. "Would I wan't to date a guy? No. I wouldn't because I'm not attrac... Am I attracted to men?" By the end of the night, I had known the answers to these questions. I am attracted to men, and I would date a man. I went to sleep happy knowing I knew a part of myself a little better.

</p><p><b>December 31, 2016:</b> My girlfriend was over my house and me, her, and my mom, were discussing various things. Somehow we got to the discussion of sexuality. Me, not wanting to make a big deal out of things, said, since it relevant to the conversation "I'm bisexual", and so my mom asks "You're bisexual?" I had always felt safe doing this because my parents had always said they were OK with me being gay. She was showing lots of support and, in between tears, talking about how amazing it is that kids can just do that without fear of criticism.

</p><p>It's almost 2:00 am, so I think I will wrap up there and continue tomorrow. Tomorrow, I will discuss 2017.

		<li><h2> Updates</h2> </li>
		<li><h6>November 15, 2016</h6></li>
	</ul>
		
		<p>I've been gone for very long, from this blog, (I'm a sophomore in High School now) and from making conlangs (if you haven't seen my work on conlangs, visit this. I haven't been on here a lot because I just have no motivation to tell everyone about my life, and this will probably remain dead, but I will still work on some other stuff.

</p><p>Other stuff includes: actually making Nicbudd.com, designing it, and hosting it, finishing the conlangs, moving all the sites off of their horrible google sites and onto the new Nicbudd.com, and designing a new logo/design. Some of this may have to wait because I don't have a job. I am thinking about getting a job at a tea place, but I don't meet some of their requirements. Soon I will meet their requirements, however.

</p><p>Here are some of the reasons I've been gone:</p>
<ol>
	<li>I got a girlfriend, and she's taken time away from the projects. When we started dating, I knew that I would have less time, and we started dating at the beginning of October. This is about when I stopped. I'm with her on the weekends, and that is why I've haven't been doing projects.</li>
	<li>I was in a high school play. I especially haven't been here for the past few weeks because of the play. The play just finished, so I'll be able to write more and be more active</li>
	<li>(For conlanging specifically) I've lost motivation for Zythe. It will be continued, I do have motivation now, but I didn't for a while, I do have other projects I've been working on, so it may go a little slowly.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, new stuff coming, new website, logo, etc., and sorry for the delay.</p>
