<p>
  I often see people get these two meteorological terms mixed up, it’s a bit of
a pet peeve of mine, and I’m making this post to clear up some confusion.</p>

<p>
  Climate change is a phenomenon caused by a rapid increase in average global
  temperature caused by excess anthropogenic “greenhouse gasses” entering the
  atmosphere. Climate scientists are in strong consensus over the existence of
  human-caused climate change, and have warned of the disastrous effects of it
  which need to be addressed immediately, which could cause crises such as the
  collapse of ecosystems, species extinction, the shutdown of the thermohaline
  circulation, which would lead to more drastic changes in climate, other
  climate system tipping points, food and clean water issues, and a complete
  change in society. In no way am I denying the negative effects of climate
  change.
</p>

<p>
  However, I often see people on social media deciding specific weather events
  as being “caused by” or evidence of the existence/non-existence of climate
  change. This just makes little sense, because:
</p>

<h5>Weather is not climate.</h5>

<p>
  The uninformed social media user generally does not have the knowledge to
  connect weather to climate. They do not statistically analyze the weather with
  past events to come to their conclusion, they see anomalous weather events
  and attribute it to climate change. At the end of the day, the day-to-day
  weather at the moment is not heavily influenced by climate. A major hurricane
  hitting a major city is not evidence of climate change, a wildfire ripping
  through a wooded town in California is not evidence of climate change, and
  a heatwave in the US is not evidence of climate change.
</p>

<p>
  This may seem like a silly gripe to have with social media, but I believe this
  behavior is <em>actively harming climate change awareness</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Take for example the pseudo-scientific climate change denial movement. When
  they see low temperatures and record breaking cold and use that to justify
  their beliefs, we laugh at them for not understanding that weather is not
  climate. However, some of the same people will turn around and claim the exact
  opposite, that high temperatures and record breaking warmth is evidence of
  climate change. Both arguments are pointless oversimplification of the issues
  that dilute the actual effects of anthropogenic actions on the environment.
  Despite the existance of this field, the average person is not an attribution
  scientist and does not have the qualifications to connect weather events to
  climate.

<h6>“It was cold outside today” does not prove climate change wrong.</h6>
<h6>“It was hot outside today” does not prove climate change right.</h6>

<p>
  We do not stoop to the level of pseudo-science in science. Science is better
  than this.
</p>

<p>
  Even though weather and climate are not the same, there exists a field to
  connect the two called “attribution science” which seeks to attribute extreme
  weather events to climate change. They generally use climate models to compare
  an event occurring in an unwarmed world versus. In my opinion the link
  between weather and climate is somewhat tenuous, and there are certainly
  limitations to the field, but they have been able to attribute the 2021
  Northwestern US heatwave to being more intense due to climate change.
</p>

<h3>Final note</h3>

<p>
  A memo to those who classify the current conditions as a "climate emergency":
  The current warming of the planet is at about 1°C above the
  pre-industrial average. With current climate policies the temperature is
  expected to reach 2.8-3.2°C. If you believe the current state of weather, with
  a slightly higher likelihood of hurricanes, heatwaves, and droughts, is bad,
  just wait a few decades, and then maybe you’ll realize what an actual climate
  emergency is like.
