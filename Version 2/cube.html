<div class="lightergrayblock"><h1>Cube Stuff</h1>

<p>I like to solve twisty puzzles in my free time. Every so often, I compete in national and local competitions to beat my fastest times. You can find my fastest times in competition on my WCA profile. You can find my fastest times at home on my CubePB page. You can find reconstructions of my solves down below, in my competitions section.</p>

</div><div class="redblock"><h2>Events</h2>

<p>I can solve the 3x3 cube (also known as the "Rubik's Cube") in around 20 seconds, but I also compete in a variety of other events. I compete in all the events from 2x2 to 7x7, 3x3 One-Handed, Pyraminx, and hope to compete in Megaminx, 3x3 Blindfolded, 3x3 With Feet, Clock, and 3x3 Mulit-Blind. In the grid below, the first number is my best single time in seconds, and the second number is my best average time in seconds (5 solves per round, an "average" excludes the best and worst and takes the average of the 3 in the middle)</p>

</div><div class="blueblock" id="comps"><h2>CubingUSA Nationals 2018</h2><h4>July 27-29, 2018</h4>

<p>Recently, I was fotunate enough to travel from my home in New Hampshire all the way to Utah to compete in the CubingUSA Nationals 2018 (some times shortened to "USA Nationals" or just "Nats").</p>
<p>I met plenty of great people. I got to talk to current and former world record holders, such as Feliks Zemdegs, Mats Valk, Kevin Hays, Kian Mansour, Patrick Ponce, Sebastian Weyer, Rami Sbahi, Jayden McNeill, Chris Olson, Drew Brads, and other famous people, such as Dylan Wang (known as J Perm), Jesse Hartnett (known as JRCuber), Andrew Nathenson (known as ColorfulPockets), and so many other notable people. I also gained quite a few great friends there who I still keep in touch with.</p>
<p>When I competed, I was very nervous and didn't break any of my 3x3 Personal Records (abbreviated as PR), or make it past the first round in any event, but I did beat both of my records in 2x2.</p>
<p>Below are the reconstructions of my 3x3 solves. The tables show exactly what moves I made, the time it took me to do each step, the turn speed of each step (TPS, or turns per second), and the amount of turns each step took. I will also give a commentary on each solve. The chart and commentary is aimed towards advanced speedsolvers and will probably be hard to understand if you aren't one.</p>

<p>This starting solve wasn't that great. It was my slowest cross out of all the solves and was a terrible solution. I only fully planned out 2 cross pieces and partially planned out the other 2. I had to pause to figure out where to put those pieces. I paused and freaked out after my cross, on my first pair because of course I wasn't tracking those pieces. The rest of F2L went mostly smoothly, except I did the same terrible solution for Pair 3 and 4. I took the edge out in a way that made it not paired up with the corner, which means I wasted more moves pairing it up again. The last layer was pretty standard, but I would like to be able to recognize PLL in 2 looks, and learn the M2 fingertrick.</p>
