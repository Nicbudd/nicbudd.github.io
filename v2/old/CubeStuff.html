	<p>So when I started the solve, I found a very easy XCross on white. Normally I don't make a XCrosses in solves, but this one was so obvious and easy to make that it would be stupid to not make it. After inspection, where I did <b>y x2</b>, all I had to do was 3 moves, <b>F2 L' R</b>.
	</p><p>The first pair I saw was oddly the Orange-Blue pair.  I stupidly took the edge out by rotating <b>y'</b> and doing <b>L' U' L</b>. This was bad because I took it out unpaired, which meant I had to spend extra time pairing it up, with <b>y U' R U2 R'</b> before inserting it with <b>U2 R U' R'</b>.
	</p><p>While I was inserting the Orange-Blue pair I noticed the Red-Green pair was paired up before I broke it up. Normally I am not good with lookahead, so this was convenient because I now knew where those were. Unfortunately I didn't do the easier Blue-Red pair because I was focused on the Red-Green pair.  I did <b>y2</b>, which is bad because I could've done it from the back, but right now I am terrible at doing pairs from the back, and then <b>U2 R U R'</b> to pair them up, and <b> U2 R U' R'</b> to insert it.
	</p><p>The last pair was pretty standard for me. I rotated to face the slot with <b>y'</b>, moved the corner out of the way with <b>U</b> and took the edge out with <b>R U R'</b>, which paired the pieces up. I then did <b>U2 R U R'</b> to insert it.
	</p><p>OLL was pretty easy, and it was a case I already know very well.  This is the point in the video that I sit up and realize that I'm gonna get an amazing time.
	</p><p>PLL was a U-Perm, which is where I kinda messed up. I used to use the <R, U> alg, but I had just started to retrain myself to do the <M, U> version.  I didn't have very good finger tricks for it at the time, and I was nervous seeing that the time was at under 10 seconds and I just had to do U Perm. Maybe if I had done it faster I would've gotten a sub-12 time, and that would be my overall PB. Whatever the case I still got an amazing time and I'm proud of it.
