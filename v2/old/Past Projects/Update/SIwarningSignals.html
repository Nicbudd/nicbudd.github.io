<h1>
Strength Intensity (SI) Warning System
</h1>
<p>So recently I heard that Typhoon Hato hit Hong Kong, which caused them to raise a Signal 10 warning. That reminded me of when Typhoon Haiyan hit the Philippines and they raised a Signal #4 warning. That got me to thinking, why doesn’t the US have a similar system? Well, we do, kinda. </p>

<p> We have our system of Tropical Storm and Hurricane watches and warnings, which aren’t helpful. Many people in places like Florida simply don’t care about a Hurricane Warning, they get them all the time. When the big ones come, there is no way to tell which ones are stronger and which are weaker with the current system. </p>

<p> So I made my own. It doesn’t use wind speed, storm surge, or any solid metric of measuring how strong storms are. It’s based on how badly the storm will affect the area it hits. Here’s how it works. </p>

<p> Each warning has a letter and a number. The 5 letters represent how badly the storm will affect the area, where A is very little impact and E is catastrophic damage. The number is in how many days landfall is predicted. So a tropical storm expected to make landfall in 5 days with very little damage to some area, in that area an A5 signal will be raised. It’s simple to understand and should be used to take the area into account. A Category 1 hurricane usually doesn’t affect florida all that much, but hurricane force winds over a place like New England would spell trouble.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:none;padding:0;margin:0;">
<li><h2 style= "color:#316FA6;">A</h2>If you are issued an "A" level advisory, there is not much to worry about. You might experience some rain and winds, but little to no structural damage will be inflicted.</li>
<li><h2 style= "color:#48AD73;">B</h2>If you are issued a "B" advisory, be a little cautious about the storm. Rain and winds will likely be associated with this storm, and you might want to have a hurricane readiness plan just incase.</li>
<li><h2 style= "color:#B2825E;">C</h2>If you are issued a "C" advisory, be prepared for high winds, heavy rain, and possibly structural damage. Make sure you have hurricane readiness plans in place.</li>
<li><h2 style= "color:#C14747;">D</h2>If you are issued a "D" advisory, prepare for a very intense storm. There may be high winds, heavy rain, flooding, structrual damage, downed trees, storm surge, loss of life, and everything else associated with hurricanes. Have a hurricane readiness plan in place and evacuate if told.</li>
<li><h2 style= "color:#B25EAE;">E</h2>If you are issued an "E" advisory, this will most likely be one of the most powerful storms you will experience in your lifetime. There will probably be high winds, heavy rain, flooding, structrual damage, downed trees, storm surge, loss of life, hail, tornadoes and everything else associated with hurricanes. Have a hurricane readiness plan in place and evacuate if told.</li>
