	Creamy Tabasco Burger
		
	</h1>
			
	<p>I used to hate burgers for the longest time. I still do to some extent. I can't eat a burger with no toppings. I might be able to stand a cheeseburger in between a bun for a while, but all burgers have to have something on them.</p>
	<p>I was making burgers one day (yesterday, as I'm writing this), and talking to my friend, when he suggested a burger he really likes to make. He called it The C**guzzler 9000, and it had a simple recipe: put some mayo on the burger, put some sriracha on the burger, and then eat it. I liked his idea, and it sounded good, but Iit was too simple, and I didn't have a good burger recipe. I went into the fridge and I pulled out a bunch of ingredients. I put them on a burger and it tasted amazing. So, I want to share it with you!</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
	<li>1 Raw Hamburger Patty</li>
	<li>1 Hamburger Bun</li>
	<li>1 Slice of Cheese (any type, I prefer Pepper Jack, but American works fine)</li>
	<li>2 tsp of Mayonnaise</li>
	<li>1-2 tsp Tabasco Sauce (to taste)</li>
	<li>3 Full Leaves of Lettuce</li>
	<li>1 tbsp + 1 tsp of Sour Cream</li>
	<li>1 tsp of Minced Garlic</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Preparation</h2>
	<ol>
	<li>Cook the patty to taste and desired doneness (yes thats the proper term for it, look it up)</li>
	<li>When you turn it over for the last time, and you are sure that it is done <b>(please test that it is safe!!!!)</b>, put your slice of cheese on it until it melts, and the burger fully cooks.</li>
	<li>After you are done, put it aside, and dump out the grease from the pan. DO NOT CLEAN THE PAN.</li>
	<li>Turn the heat down to medium-low, and put the bun in the pan, with the side that will be touching the burger down. Cook until it browns and becomes hard.</li>
	<li>Take the bun out of the pan and put it on a plate. To the bottom bun, add the mayonnaise and tabasco sauce. On top of that, add the patty, cheese side up. Add the lettuce, and then to the top bun, add the sour cream and garlic. Put the top bun on the rest of the burger.</li>
	<li>Enjoy!</li>
	</ol>
