	<p>Before I get started explaining how to solve a cube, I would like to go over some basics about the cube.</p>

<p>It is harder to solve the cube if you think about it in terms of “sides”, like solving the white side, then the blue side, etc. Instead, think of it as “pieces” to put in the right places.</p>

<p>There are 3 types of pieces: “centers”, which don’t move; “edges”, which have 2 sides; and “corners”, which have 3 sides.</p>

<p>Now that you know that, we can learn how to solve the cube.</p>

<p>The first step is to solve the “cross”. The “cross” is a shape that can be built on a cube that is made by putting 4 edge pieces of one color in the correct spots, so that it lines up with the centers. </p>
