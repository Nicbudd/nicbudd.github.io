<h1>Instructions</h1>
<div class="important">It is very important that you follow all of the instructions for this wishlist very carefully, because it is very easy to mess up the order.</div>
<h2>Step 0: Intro</h2>
<p>When you finish reading <em>ALL</em> of the instructions, click or tap the button at the bottom labelled "Table". You should see a table with a numbered list of items, up to 3 prices, and customization options. This is my christmas wishlist. This year, I want rubiks cubes, and those are the only things on my wishlist. The 3 prices are the prices from the 3 companies that have what I want.</p>
<hr>
<h2> Step 1: Find the item</h2>
<p>Find a product that is in a reasonable price range that is high on my list. Also, talk to other people who are buying me presents to make sure you don't all get the same one. Then, when you see the product name, look to the right of that, and find the cheapest price of the green buttons</p>
<hr>
<h2> Step 2: Customization</h2>
<p><em><mark>THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP, AND THE HARDEST ONE TO FOLLOW, SO READ CAREFULLY</mark></em></p>
<p> Choose the website you went to.</p>
